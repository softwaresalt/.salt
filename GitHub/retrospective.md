## The Prime Directive
The purpose of the Prime Directive is to assure that a retrospective has the right culture to make it a positive and result oriented event. It makes a retrospective become an effective team gathering to learn and find solutions to improve the way of working.

"Regardless of what we discover, we understand and truly believe that everyone did the best job they could, given what they knew at the time, their skills and abilities, the resources available, and the situation at hand."

_--Norm Kerth, Project Retrospectives: A Handbook for Team Review_

## The Process
We will continue using a DROP, ADD, KEEP, IMPROVE model for our retrospective feedback.
In GitHub projects, we will manage the retrospective as a native issue type.
All team members will be assigned to the retrospective for tracking and awareness purposes.

Throughout the project, you will provide your feedback as a comment in the comments section of the retrospective issue.
Limit the comment to just one item and area of feedback, e.g. DROP: Too much time spent in meetings.
You are free to provide this feedback throughout the project or you can send me your feedback privately and I will include it as a comment under my own alias to keep it anonymous.

We will conduct voting during the retrospective session on items via the _like_ feature.  Just give a thumbs up to feedback you agree with. After voting is done, we'll tally up the results and decide as a team on a single item to follow up on as an actionable user story for the next sprint.
