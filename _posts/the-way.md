# The Way: A Pragmatic Manifesto for Agile

I won't belabor the topic of Agile process; it's covered.  
The way we work is a distinctly human concern, so the tools we use matter less.  
This is about the way **to be** an Agile team => to win as a team => to Win.  

1. Be generous.
1. Be safe.
1. Be disciplined.
1. Be honest.
1. Be pragmatic.
<!--1. Be a low-key hustler-->


## Be Generous
It's like the good book says: give and ye shall receive.  This is human dynamics 101. Be kind. Be generous.  
As a team, we have to deliver in order to win. We have to deliver many things: code, documentation, feature demos, status.  
A team is not an archipeligo of individuals; everyone has to work... together.  
From a practical perspective, why does generosity matter?  
When we help others on our team to be successful, we help the whole team to be successful.  Further, it develops the capabilities of others by investing in them, which enables us to delegate those things in the future like compounding interest, we get paid back on the initial loan. The team represents a kind of economy: trading favors is just good business.


## Be Safe
We are in the business of ideas and delivering on them, which requires focus.  
Unsafe environments are deeply distracting.  Ever been scolded by a manager in front of others?  Ever been yelled at or witnessed someone else being yelled at in a professional environment?  Ever tried to focus and get anything done after experiencing that?  It's abysmal.  
Trust is the foundation of all relationships, which is the foundation of almost all business.  Our economy could not function without organized structures of trust. A bank is an institution of trust.  Banks loan money out to business and individuals to enable them to do things they wouldn't otherwise be able to.  Trust makes the world go round!  

The most fundamental element of every team culture needs to be trust and safety.
It has been demonstrated that children who grow up in unsafe neighborhoods show very poor results in educational environments because they are too distracted by their existential concerns to be able to focus on learning new things.  This is fundamentally true of everyone.

If you want people to perform, you need to have a safe place for them to work in.
Winning requires performance, so be very protective of your team culture if you care about winning.


## Be Disciplined




## Be Honest






## Be Pragmatic
Always be thinking: what am I trying to accomplish? What is my objective?
Do the words you use or the behavior you present further your objective?
